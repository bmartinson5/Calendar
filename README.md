# Group4CanlenderApp

This is a group project for software engineering class. It is a fully functionalcalendar app that allows users to add, save and delete events, and merge two calendars. A database stores information event information from each user, and can be loaded by using a key that is given when creating a new calendar. 

The app runs on a flask restful server which acts as a seperate api. The front end web interface uses react js.
